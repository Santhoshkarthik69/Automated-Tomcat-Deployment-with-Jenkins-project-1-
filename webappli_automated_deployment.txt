Project Idea: Automated Deployment of a Simple Web Application
Project Overview:
         The project involves creating an automated pipeline for deploying a static web application using Jenkins for continuous integration and Docker for containerization. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the application, ensuring a smooth and consistent deployment process.
Automate the Build Process:
         Use Jenkins to automate the build process whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.
Containerize the Application:
         Package the web application in a Docker container for consistent deployment.
Automate Deployment: 
         Deploy the Docker container to a local Docker environment automatically via Jenkins.
Objectives:
Technologies Used:
Jenkins:
         For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
Docker:
         For containerizing the application.
Git:
         For version control.
Docker Compose: 
         For managing multi-container Docker applications (optional, if needed).
Shell Scripting:
         For deployment scripts.
Project Setup and Configuration:
Step 1: Prepare the Application
  Create a simple web application (e.g., an HTML/CSS/JS website).
  Ensure the application is working locally.
Step 2: Set Up Docker
   Create a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile to build a Docker image for the web application.

       ```Dockerfile

          # Use an official Nginx image as a parent image
          FROM nginx:alpine
          # Copy the application files to the container
          COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
 
    Build Docker Image:
            Run `docker build -t my-web-app .` to build the Docker image.
Step 3: Set Up Jenkins
  Install Jenkins:
               Install Jenkins on your machine or use a hosted version.
  Install Plugins:
               Install necessary plugins like *Git*, *Docker*, and *Pipeline*.
  Create a New Job:
               Set up a new Jenkins job (e.g., a freestyle project or a pipeline).
  Source Code Management:
               Configure the job to pull code from a Git repository.
  Build Triggers
              Set up triggers (e.g., on code push to Git).
  Build Steps:
             Add steps to build the Docker image.

            ```shell
              docker build -t my-web-app .
            ```

 Post-Build Actions:

           Introduction:
This document outlines the process and setup for automating the deployment of a simple web application using Jenkins and Docker. The goal is to demonstrate an automated CI/CD pipeline.
Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the Repository:

          ```bash
          git clone [repository-url]
         ```
2. Build Docker Image:

          ```bash
         docker build -t my-web-app .
          ```

3. Run Docker Container:

           ```bash
          docker run -d -p 80:80 my-web-app
           ```
4. Configure Jenkins:
   -     Install necessary plugins.
   -     Create a Jenkins job to automate the build and deployment process.

Troubleshooting:
   -     Issue: Docker container fails to start.
   -    Solution: Check Dockerfile for errors and ensure all files are correctly copied.

Future Improvements:
  -     Enhance Security: Implement security best practices for Docker and Jenkins.
  -     Scale Deployment:Explore Kubernetes for scaling the application.

 Conclusion:
                This project successfully demonstrates the automation of a web application deployment
 using Jenkins and Docker, showcasing fundamental DevOps skills.
